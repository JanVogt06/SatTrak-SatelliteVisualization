    m_Localized: "<u>International Space Station (ISS)</u>\n\nIn service since 1998,
      the ISS circles Earth every 90 minutes at roughly 400 km altitude. It is a
      joint project of NASA, Roscosmos, ESA, JAXA and CSA and has been permanently
      inhabited since November 2000. More than 3 000 experiments in micro-gravity,
      biology, technology and Earth observation have been conducted on board. The
      station offers about 930 m\xB3 of pressurised volume - comparable to a six-bedroom
      house - and can be seen with the naked eye. Current plans call for operation
      until at least 2030, after which commercial outposts are expected to take over."

    m_Localized: "<u>Hubble Space Telescope (HST)</u>\n\nDeployed on 24 April 1990
      by Space Shuttle Discovery, Hubble\u2019s 2.4 m mirror provides diffraction-limited
      imaging above Earth\u2019s atmosphere. Five servicing missions between 1993
      and 2009 corrected optics and upgraded instruments, enabling landmark deep-field
      views and precise measurements of cosmic expansion. Hubble continues to operate
      at ~540 km altitude, working alongside newer observatories such as JWST. Its
      data have generated more than 20 000 peer-reviewed papers spanning ultraviolet
      to near-infrared astronomy. Without a de-orbit mission, atmospheric re-entry
      is projected for the late 2030s."

    m_Localized: '<u>Sentinel-6 Michael Freilich</u>


      Launched on 21 November
      2020, this altimetry satellite extends the precise sea-level record begun by
      TOPEX/Poseidon in 1992. Operating in a 1 336 km sun-synchronous orbit, its
      Poseidon-4 radar measures global mean sea level to millimetre accuracy. Sentinel-6
      is a partnership of ESA, EUMETSAT, NASA and NOAA, with the twin Sentinel-6B
      planned for 2025. A GNSS radio-occultation payload also derives atmospheric
      temperature and humidity profiles. The mission will keep high-quality ocean-topography
      data flowing through at least 2030.'

      released on 15 April 2023 during SpaceX\u2019s Transporter-7 rideshare and
      augments Kepler\u2019s growing Gen-1 constellation. Each satellite, built in
      Toronto, combines Ku-band broadband with narrow-band IoT links to form a global
      store-and-forward network. Future units will add optical inter-satellite lasers
      for real-time relay services. Weighing about 10 kg, Kepler-20 orbits in a 97\xB0
      sun-synchronous path at 575 km altitude. The long-term aim is a space-based
      \u201CInternet for things,\u201D enabling constant connectivity for remote
      sensors, ships and spacecraft."

      this satellite was launched on 2 March 2024 and operates in a 550 km low-Earth
      orbit. Phased-array antennas deliver broadband internet with latencies below
      30 ms, while optical laser links route data directly between satellites. Electric
      propulsion handles station-keeping and controlled de-orbit after roughly five
      years. Starlink now exceeds 7 300 active satellites\u2014the largest fleet
      in history. Mitigation measures such as darker coatings and coordinated manoeuvres
      aim to reduce brightness and collision risk."
